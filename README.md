## 
- 👋 Hi, I’m @steven-hill
- 🌱 I’m looking for an iOS developer role.
- 📚 To deepen my iOS knowledge I've been reading books on Swift, Apple's testing frameworks, and Core Data, and implementing what I've learned in my projects.
- 📖 Currently I'm reading "Mastering Swift 6" by Jon Hoffman.
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-hill-570913230).


## About me

I’m focused on writing clean, scalable, maintainable and testable code, and helping companies build great mobile app experiences.

My first Apple device was an iPad. Learning iOS development was born out of a curiosity about how the iPad works and how it can become anything in the user’s hands. Since then, I've been building mobile app solutions with Swift, UIKit and SwiftUI. I love how software development gives us various tools to use to solve interesting problems. There are always more exciting things to learn!
