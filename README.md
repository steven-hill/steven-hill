## Steven Hill, iOS developer
- I’m looking for an iOS developer role.
- To deepen my iOS knowledge I've been reading books on Swift, Apple's testing frameworks, and Core Data, and implementing what I've learned in my projects.
- Passionate about accessibility, and testing.
- Focused on writing clean, scalable, maintainable and testable code, and helping companies build great mobile app experiences.
