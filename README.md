### About me

Iâ€™m focused on writing clean, maintainable code, and helping companies build great mobile app experiences. My first Apple device was an iPad. Learning iOS development was born out of a curiosity about how the iPad works and how it can become anything in the userâ€™s hands. Since then, I've been learning how to build mobile app solutions with Swift, UIKit and SwiftUI. I love how software development gives us various tools to use to solve interesting problems. There are always more exciting things to learn!


### Skills

- iOS
- UIKit
- SwiftUI
- Xcode
- GitHub


### Projects

- MovieList
  - This app uses UIKit and a wholly programmatic UI.
  - Users can search for a movie using the name of the movie. The app uses the iTunes API to surface results in a UITableView.
  - The user can tap on a result to see more information about that movie and watch the trailer via AVPlayer.
  - If the user is interested in watching the movie, they can add it to the favourites list (accessible via the tab bar).
  - I chose UserDefaults for persistence of the favourites list as the memory space requirement is small.
  - This project really helped me to understand the protocol and delegate pattern, coordinators, and MVC.


- Weather
  - I'm currently building this app, and it's my first SwiftUI app.
  - It uses CoreLocation to get the user's location and make a network call to the Open Weather API to get the current weather data for that location.
  - It also uses WidgetKit for the home screen widget which provides glanceable information for the user.
  - This app has allowed me to learn MVVM, and more frameworks - SwiftUI, CoreLocation and WidgetKit.


- Job application tracker
  - This app uses UIKit and mixes storyboard and programmatic UI.
  - Users can add, view, delete and edit job applications via sheets. The dashboard view provides the user with information to track their applications at a top level.
  - I utilised UICollectionView to display the array of job applications to the user.
  - I implemented persistence with CoreData.
  - This project gave me further practice with the protocol and delegate pattern, and MVC.
