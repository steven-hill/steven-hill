## 
- 👋 Hi, I’m @steven-hill
- 🌱 I’m looking for an iOS developer role.
- 📚 To deepen my iOS knowledge I've been reading books on Swift, Apple's testing frameworks, and Core Data, and implementing what I've learned in my projects.
- 📖 Currently I'm reading "Mastering Swift 6" by Jon Hoffman.
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-hill-570913230).


## About me

I’m focused on writing clean, scalable, maintainable and testable code, and helping companies build great mobile app experiences. I build mobile app solutions with Swift, UIKit and SwiftUI. I love how software development gives us various tools to use to solve interesting problems, and there is always more to learn!
