# Steven Hill
## iOS developer

- 👋 Hi, I’m @steven-hill
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, mobile gaming, sports, languages and travel.
- 🌱 I’m looking for an iOS developer role.
- 📫 You can reach me on [X](https://twitter.com/H_Steven1) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-hill-570913230).


## About me

I’m focused on writing clean, scalable and maintainable code, and helping companies build great mobile app experiences. Currently I'm learning building apps with SOLID principles and TDD. 

My first Apple device was an iPad. Learning iOS development was born out of a curiosity about how the iPad works and how it can become anything in the user’s hands. Since then, I've been learning how to build mobile app solutions with Swift, UIKit and SwiftUI. I love how software development gives us various tools to use to solve interesting problems. There are always more exciting things to learn!
