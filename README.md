### About me

Iâ€™m focused on writing clean, maintainable code, and helping companies build great mobile app experiences. My first Apple device was an iPad. Learning iOS development was born out of a curiosity about how the iPad works and how it can become anything in the userâ€™s hands. Since then, I've been learning how to build mobile app solutions with Swift, UIKit and SwiftUI. I love how software development gives us various tools to use to solve interesting problems. There are always more exciting things to learn!

### Projects

- [MovieList](https://github.com/steven-hill/MovieList) - a UIKit project to search for movies using the iTunes API.

- [Job application tracker](https://github.com/steven-hill/Job-application-tracker) - a UIKit project to track job applications using CoreData.
  
- Weather
  - I'm currently building this app, and it's my first SwiftUI app.
  - It uses CoreLocation to get the user's location and make a network call using the Open Weather API to get the current weather data for that location.
  - It also uses WidgetKit for the home screen widget which provides glanceable information for the user.
  - This app has allowed me to learn MVVM, and more frameworks - SwiftUI, CoreLocation and WidgetKit.
  - By practicing and picking up these frameworks I delved a lot into Apple's documentation. I started with the documentation when implementing the frameworks, and, as a result, I've become more confident and familiar with Apple's documentation.
