### About me

Iâ€™m focused on writing clean, maintainable code, and helping companies build great mobile app experiences. My first Apple device was an iPad. Learning iOS development was born out of a curiosity about how the iPad works and how it can become anything in the userâ€™s hands. Since then, I've been learning how to build mobile app solutions with Swift, UIKit and SwiftUI. I love how software development gives us various tools to use to solve interesting problems. There are always more exciting things to learn!
